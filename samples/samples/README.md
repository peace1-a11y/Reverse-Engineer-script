## Lua Reverse Engineering Sample

This sample demonstrates how an obfuscated script with unclear logic and variable names can be reversed into a readable version. It mimics simple logic transformations and string operations for demonstration purposes.

### Features:
- Reconstructed function flow
- Renamed variables for clarity
- Comments added for understanding

**Note:** This is a simulated educational sample. It is not tied to real protection like Luraph.
