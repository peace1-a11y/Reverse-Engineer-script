# Reverse-Engineer-script

This project demonstrates my ability to reverse engineer Lua scripts in a clean, ethical, and educational way.

🧠 **What it includes:**
- A sample Lua file showing how obfuscated code can be made readable
- Clear variable/function renaming and code structure restoration
- Well-commented code to demonstrate understanding of control flow and string handling

💬 I’m open to custom reverse engineering work (within legal and ethical guidelines) and Lua-based automation projects.
